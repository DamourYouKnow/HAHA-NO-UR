## Pull Request Process

1. Create a fork.  
2. Make your changes.  
3. Submit a pull request to merge your changes into this repository's dev branch. Don't PR into master please thanks.   
4. If your code runs and passes review, I'll merge your pull request. If there are any problems I will addresss changes and work with you on addressing them.   

Please label your commits so that changes can be easily identified.
