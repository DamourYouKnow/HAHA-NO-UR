```
## 1.3.0 | 2018-12-01

### Added
- Feedback now logs your discriminator so that I can actually get in touch 
with people for clarification purposes.
- More aliases.

### Fixed
- You no longer get a scary message if you try to idolize a card that isn't in 
your album. You'll now get a less scary message saying you don't have the card.
- The bot will no longer get confused when someone posts an attachment with no 
message.
